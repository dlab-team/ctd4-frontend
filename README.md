# Devsafio WEB

## Project Description
Web project for the DLAB company that aims to be a bridge between digital talents and IT companies.
To meet this objective, the Incubadora Desafio-Latam was asked to create a platform capable of managing as users those graduates who are looking for work in the area of ​​technology, to then make available the respective technical tests requested by the companies and generate a Job-Ready profile that certifies them in their future applications.
- [Swagger Link](wip)

## Dependencies
This project was built mainly with the following technologies:
- `Javascript`
- `React`
- `Node.js`
- `For the visual part we will use the CSS framework Tailwind`

- ### Running the App for frontend and backend separately
#### Frontend
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
#### Backend
```
npm install
make network
make run
```
# Project Usage - Backend
Step by step of the commands to execute
Check the `package.json` file for `npm` commands
To run this project you previously need to install:
- `docker` & `docker-compose`

- ### Running the App with Docker
Here you will run the application with Docker. it's easy to write. You can...
#### Create the container's network
```
make network
```
#### Starting the containers
```
make run
```
#### Access the container through SSH
```
make enter
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
